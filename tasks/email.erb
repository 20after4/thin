Hey all,

Version <%= Thin::VERSION::STRING %> (codename <%= Thin::VERSION::CODENAME %>) of the fastest Ruby server is out!

Thin is a Ruby web server that glues together 3 of the best Ruby libraries in web history:
 * the Mongrel parser: the root of Mongrel speed and security
 * Event Machine: a network I/O library with extremely high scalability, performance and stability
 * Rack: a minimal interface between webservers and Ruby frameworks
Which makes it, with all humility, the most secure, stable, fast and extensible Ruby web server
bundled in an easy to use gem for your own pleasure.

== What's new?

* Add cluster support through the -s option in the thin script, start 3 thins like this:
   thin start -s3 -p3000
  3 thin servers will be started on port 3000, 3001, 3002, also the port number will be
  injected in the pid and log filenames.
* Fix IOError when writing to logger when starting server as a daemon.
* Really change directory when the -c option is specified.
* Add restart command to thin script.
* Fix typos in thin script usage message and expand chdir path.
* Rename thin script options to be the same as mongrel_rails script [thronedrk]:
    -o --host  => -a --address
    --log-file => --log
    --pid-file => --pid
    --env      => --environment

win32 support is coming soon!

== Get it!

 sudo gem install thin
 
(Might take some time for the gem mirrors to be updated, try adding
--source http://code.macournoyer.com to the command if it doesn't work)

NOTE: if you installed a previous alpha version (if you have 0.5.2 already installed)
uninstall it before: sudo gem uninstall thin
