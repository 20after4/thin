== Thin
Tiny, fast & funny Ruby server

Thin is a high performance and customizable Ruby server. It's structured much like Nginx. A
master process listen to incoming requests and dispatch to its worker processes, each one
running an EventMachine event loop.

Which makes it, with all humility, the most secure, stable, fast and extensible Ruby web server
bundled in an easy to use gem for your own pleasure.
