== Thin
Tiny, fast & funny HTTP server

Thin is a web server written entirely in Ruby in the simplest way possible.
It does as little as possible to serve your Rails application,
which makes it one of the fastest Rails server out there.

=== Installation
For the latest stable version:

 sudo gem install thin

or using my mirror:

 sudo gem install thin --source http://code.macournoyer.com

Or from source:

 svn co http://code.macournoyer.com/svn/thin/trunk thin
 cd thin
 rake install

=== Usage
Thin is usable through Rack +rackup+ command. You need to setup a config.ru file and require thin in it:
  
 rackup -s thin example/config.ru
 
See example/config.ru for details and rackup -h
