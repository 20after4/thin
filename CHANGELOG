== 0.6.2 Rambo release
 * Restructure thin script options in 3 sections: server, daemon and cluster
 * Add --only (-o) option to control only one server of a cluster.
 * Stylize stats page and make the url configurable from the thin script.
 * Raise error if attempting to use unix sockets on windows.
 * Add example config files for http://www.tildeslash.com/monit useage.
   Include the example file using "include /path/to/thin/monit/file" in your monitrc file.
   The group settings let you do this to manage your clusters:
   
     sudo monit -g blog restart all
    
   There are examples of thin listening on sockets and thin listening on unix sockets.

== 0.6.1 Cheesecake release
 * Remove socket file when server stops.
 * Set back cluster to use 'thin' command to launch servers.

== 0.6.0 Big Pony release
 * Add support for connection through UNIX domain socket.
   Use the --socket (-S) option w/ the thin script to configure the socket filename.
   Nginx support binding to a UNIX socket like this:
   
     upstream  backend {
       server   unix:/tmp/thin.0.sock;
       server   unix:/tmp/thin.1.sock;
       server   unix:/tmp/thin.2.sock;
     }
  
   Start your servers like this:
   
     thin start -s3 -S/tmp/thin.sock
   
 * Remove Server#listen! method. Use Server#start instead.
 * Server can now yield a Rack::Builder to allow building an app in one call:
 
     Server.start '0.0.0.0', 3000 do
       use Rack::CommonLogger
       use Rack::ShowExceptions
       map "/lobster" do
         use Rack::Lint
         run Rack::Lobster.new
       end
     end
     
 * Add a very basic stats page through Stats adapter, load w/ --stats and browse to /stats.
 * Add --trace (-V) option to trace request/response and get backtrace w/out all Ruby debug stuff.
 * Add --config (-C) option to load options from a config file in thin script [Matt Todd].
 * Alter response headers to output directly to a string.
 * Improve specs stability.
 * Move request body to a Tempfile if too big (> 112 MB)
 * Remove useless check for max header size in Request (already done in the parser)

== 0.5.4 Flying Mustard release
 * Don't read the full body, use direct streaming when sending response.
   See: Response#each
   As a result, the Content-Length can not be calculated anymore.
   You have to do set this in your adapter. All frameworks do it anyway.
   It improve memory usage and boost speed for low concurrency.
   Thanks to Kent Sibilev and Ezra for their help on that one.
