Hey all,

Version <%= Thin::VERSION::STRING %> (codename <%= Thin::VERSION::CODENAME %>) of the fastest Ruby server is out!

Thin is a Ruby web server that glues together 3 of the best Ruby libraries in web history:
 * the Mongrel parser: the root of Mongrel speed and security
 * Event Machine: a network I/O library with extremely high scalability, performance and stability
 * Rack: a minimal interface between webservers and Ruby frameworks
Which makes it, with all humility, the most secure, stable, fast and extensible Ruby web server
bundled in an easy to use gem for your own pleasure.

== What's new?

Welcome 2 new members to the Thin team (previously composed of me and me):
* Kevin Williams http://www.almostserio.us/
* James Golick http://jamesgolick.com/

Small release for *nix users, but big one of windows ones!

* win32 pre-compiled gem now available (send all your love to Kevin for this one)
* Add prefix option to thin script to mount app under a given path.

If you're still not sure about trying Thin, here are a couple of articles:

== Get it!

 sudo gem install thin
 
Might take some time for the gem mirrors to be updated, try adding
--source http://code.macournoyer.com to the command if it doesn't work

If you installed a previous alpha version (if you have <%= Thin::VERSION::STRING %> already installed)
uninstall it before: sudo gem uninstall thin

WARNING:
Thin is still alpha software, if you use it on your server you understand the
risks that are involved.
