== Thin
Tiny, fast & funny HTTP server

Thin is a Ruby web server that glues together 3 of the best Ruby libraries in web history:
 * the Mongrel parser: the root of Mongrel speed and security
 * Event Machine: a network I/O library with extremely high scalability, performance and stability
 * Rack: a minimal interface between webservers and Ruby frameworks
Which makes it, with all humility, the most secure, stable, fast and extensible Ruby web server
bundled in an easy to use gem for your own pleasure.

=== Installation
For the latest stable version:

 sudo gem install thin

or using my mirror (might be more recent):

 sudo gem install thin --source http://code.macournoyer.com

Or from source:

 git clone http://code.macournoyer.com/git/thin.git
 cd thin
 rake install
 
Or from the Subversion mirror (might be out of date):

 svn co http://code.macournoyer.com/svn/thin/trunk thin

=== Usage
A +thin+ script is offered to easily start your Rails application:

 cd to/your/rails/app
 thin start

But Thin is also usable through Rack +rackup+ command.
You need to setup a config.ru file and require thin in it:
  
 cat <<EOS
 require 'thin'
 
 app = proc do |env|
  [200, {'Content-Type'=>'text/html'}, ['hi']]
 end
 
 run app
 EOS
 rackup -s thin
 
See example/config.ru for details and rackup -h
