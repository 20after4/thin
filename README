== Thin

Tiny, fast & funny HTTP server

=== Why another web server ?
Thin:
 * is 10% faster then Mongrel behind a load balancer like Nginx.
 * takes around 2MB less memory then Mongrel.
 * is 100% Ruby, no C extension.
 * is self contain, no dependencies.

=== What's the catch ?
The secret of Thin is that no threads are used. Everything is running in a single thread. For single threaded frameworks like Rails this makes sense, but might not be the case for others.

=== Installation

  sudo gem install thin --source http://code.macournoyer.com

=== Usage
In your Rails app directory:
  
  thin

Run: thin -h to get more options

=== Licence
Ruby Licence : http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/LICENSE.txt

=== Credit
