Hey all,

Version <%= Thin::VERSION::STRING %>, codename <%= Thin::VERSION::CODENAME %> of the fastest Ruby server is out!

Thin is a Ruby web server that glues together 3 of the best Ruby libraries in web history:
 * the Mongrel parser: the root of Mongrel speed and security
 * Event Machine: a network I/O library with extremely high scalability, performance and stability
 * Rack: a minimal interface between webservers and Ruby frameworks
Which makes it, with all humility, the most secure, stable, fast and extensible Ruby web server
bundled in an easy to use gem for your own pleasure.

== What's new?

Even though Thin has been announced only 4 days ago, lots of things are happening:
 * Ruby 1.9 compatibility
 * Better Rails adapter
 * Thin support included in Ramaze and Vintage frameworks
 * Some bug fixes in header parsing
